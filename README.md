# SEI-Project-3

## Brewery searching React application. 
Application users may search for breweries in an area and learn more about what beers they provide. They can find a brewery's location on a map as well as learn more about it and link to its website.

### MVP
- User may browse breweries by a given city
- Search results are displayed in a list on the page
- Search results are displayed as pins on a Google map
- Clicking on a returned brewery will display additional information about that brewery
- React hooks

### Stretch Goals
- Use different map pins depending on type of establishment
- Use an API to find specific beers by brewery
- User may search by additional parameters such as:
  - Search by name
  - Browse by zip code, state
  - Browse by brewery type
- Brewery information will be displayed as a modal by the appropriate pin on the map
- animations for modals
- Brewery show page to display more information, such as Yelp reviews
