# SEI-Project-3

## Brewery searching React application. 
Application users may search for breweries in an area and learn more about what beers they provide. They can find a brewery's location on a map as well as learn more about it and link to its website.

### MVP
- User may search for breweries by a given city
- Search results are displayed in a list on the page
- search results are displayed as pins on a Google map
- clicking on a returned brewery will display additional information about that brewery

### Stretch Goals
- use different map pins depending on type of establishment
- use an API to find specific beers by brewery
- User may search by additional parameters such as zip code, state, etc

### Wireframe
